# World-Happiness-Analysis
I explore how world happiness scores are affected by various socio-economic variables. 

I utilize publicly available extremely large datasets published by government organizations & trusted NGO's like the World Bank. 

In particular, I utilize Tableau to explore these relationships. First, I explore the geospatial variation of happiness among different companies. 
As an illustration, I created a global heatmap with sliders.

Next, I utlize Tableau to create a dashboard to explore the correlation between happiness and socio-economic variables like 
GDP, Freedom Index, Family Index, and Trust in Government. 

Please, refer to the Tableau links provided in this Repository for further details.
